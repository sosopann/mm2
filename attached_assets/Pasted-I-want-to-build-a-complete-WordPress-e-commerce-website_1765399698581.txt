I want to build a complete WordPress e-commerce website for selling digital items from the Roblox game "Murder Mystery 2 (MM2)", including Knives, Guns, Bundles, and Special Packages. These are digital in‑game items, NOT real weapons.

Here is what I need you to generate for me:

1. Create a full website structure for an online MM2 shop:
   - Homepage
   - Shop page
   - Product categories: Knives, Guns, Godlys, Ancient Items, Bundles, Packages
   - Product pages with images, pricing, and descriptions
   - Cart + Checkout pages
   - Contact page

2. I want the design to look like a gaming store:
   - dark theme
   - neon highlights (blue/red)
   - MM2 style banners
   - Roblox-inspired graphics

3. Generate example product names, descriptions, and images I can upload, for at least:
   - 10 Knives
   - 10 Guns
   - 5 Godlys
   - 3 Bundles
   - 3 Packages

4. Give me step‑by‑step instructions on how to:
   - Add these products into WooCommerce
   - Add categories
   - Replace all template demo images with my own MM2 images
   - Set up the homepage using Elementor

5. Payment method setup:
   - Only manual payments for Egypt (no cards):
      • Vodafone Cash
      • InstaPay
   - Show me how to edit WooCommerce → Payments to rename “Bank Transfer” into these methods and add instructions for the customer.

6. Plugins I already have installed:
   - WooCommerce
   - Elementor
   - Starter Templates
   - CartFlows
   - Variation Swatches for WooCommerce
   - WPForms Lite
   - SureRank SEO
   - Ultimate Addons for Elementor Lite

   Explain how to use these plugins to:
   - Build the pages
   - Create good product layouts
   - Improve checkout flow
   - Improve SEO of the store

7. Remove any plugins that I don’t need (like Hello Dolly).

8. Finally, write the full step‑by‑step setup instructions in the most clear and simple way possible, with the exact WordPress menus and buttons to click.

The final output should be a complete, actionable guide to build an MM2 item shop from zero to fully working.
